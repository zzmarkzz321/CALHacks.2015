# Fnd-it web application

Fnd-it is a lost and found web application meant to bring the community together through finding and returning lost items

## What's under the hood?

1. Google geolocation for proximity calculation and locating lost items within the area
2. Built with the LAMP stack
3. Bootstrap 3 and Jquery for the front end

## Current updates:
None :( This was definitely a fun app to make!
